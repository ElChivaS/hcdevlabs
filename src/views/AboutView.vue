    <!-- <h1>This is an about page</h1> -->
    <p>I've been in the IT business for over 13 years as a Web Developer usually for
advertising agencies or consulting companies and for the last 6 years I've
been specialized on frontend development, however I have fullstack basis, I
also have experience on Tech Lead and Project Management.</p>
<p>As the greatest achievements of mi professional career I consider reaching a
level where according to my skills and knowledge I can be required to do the
job and even be taken as an example, this of course, is reflected on my
developments, some about websites with a high traffic or maybe for abroad
and when you notice that (as a final user) it happens and it's working just fine,
it's priceless.</p>
<p>I consider myself a dedicated person, I am constantly learning, checking
news, reading about newest stuff, tech, processes, better dev practices, etc.
and this, personally, has really impacted on me for academics and for the
professional field.</p>
<p>I studied at the Universidad Central de Venezuela, Licienciatura en Ciencias
de la Computaci√≥n (Computer Science); completed and approved IBM
Advanced Career Education for e-business, besides a series of courses,
workshops and online tutorials (mainly from Udemy and CodeSchools) which I
am constantly checking to keep up, with this I have managed to get the
experience I currently own.</p>
<p>I've been working for over the last two years for companies abroad, however, I
saw this job offer and the benefits are really interesting. I have specialized in
Frontend development for the last 7 years, programming on CSS
preprocessors like Saas and layouts are one of the most enjoyable tasks for
me, I have a vast experience working with JavaScript based Frameworks like
Angular, Vue and React so I think I'd be a valuable asset for this company. Of
course I am also bilingual and have experience on both cascade and agile
methodologies.</p>
